## Getting Started

To get started, [create an app](https://tracker.gg/developers/docs/getting-started).  Once created, you will immediately be issued an API Key.  This is how you will authenticate requests.

## Authentication
Add a header to your `GET` request:     
Name:  `TRN-Api-Key`  
Value: `Your api key`

Get more information [in the docs](https://tracker.gg/developers/docs/authentication).

That's it. Now follow our docs to get stats for each game.

## Rate Limits
Rate limit increase form coming soon. Your actual rate limit can be seen on the response of your requests. Contact us through Tracker.GG's support page if you are hitting your rate limit and would like an increase.

Example of response headers returned by the API:
